# Just Another Game About Cheese
(or JAGAC for short)


A Java Revamp of a game I started making in Python

I first started making this game in python after about a week of learning it, a month later I got bored of using python and stopped coding it,
the next year? remaking it for the third time in C++ and now Java

The OG versions that were made in Python and C++ can be found [here](https://github.com/MASTRIO/JAGAC)
